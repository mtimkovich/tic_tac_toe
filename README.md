Tic Tac Toe
===========

I'm working on creating a Tic Tac Toe game with an AI. Currently a work in
progress, and the AI has not been coded yet. When completed, I hope it will be
able to draw with even the best players in the world.

Moving
------

Moving is inputed in the form:

    Move: x y

With the grid looking like:

    0,0|1,0|2,0
    ---+---+---
    0,1|1,1|2,1
    ---+---+---
    0,2|1,2|2,2

Obviously, user-friendliness is not a concern at the moment.

To exit, type:
    
    Move: exit
    
    or

    Move: quit
